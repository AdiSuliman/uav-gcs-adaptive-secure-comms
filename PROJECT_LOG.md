# Project Execution Log (Living Document)

**Last Updated:** 2026-09-19 | **Status:** Phase A+B+C+EXP+Survivability complete | Phase D (dashboard + writeup) in progress

---

## Phase A: Link Model & Dataset ✅ COMPLETE

| Step | Status | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1-A2 | ✅ | 2026-08-20 | AWGN link validation, BER matches theory |
| A3 | ✅ | 2026-08-28 | Rician K=10dB, fd=160Hz: 1.43-1.53× degradation |
| A4 | ✅ | 2026-09-02 | 8 threats validated (barrage, reactive, spoofing, noise, path, antenna, sweeping, benign) |
| A5-A6 (v1) | ✅ | 2026-09-05 | Dataset: 10,686 frames, spectrograms [128×128×1] extracted |
| A5-A6 (v2) | ✅ | 2026-09-15 | Dataset expanded: `frames_per_config` 50→100 → **27,246 frames**, re-extracted after spoofing fix |

---

## Phase B: Detection ✅ COMPLETE

| Step | Status | Accuracy | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | ✅ | — | 2026-09-08 | Data split 80/10/10, z-scored 7 features |
| B2 (v1) | ✅ | 78.8% | 2026-09-09 | CNN+scalar hybrid, 7 classes |
| B2.5 | ✅ | — | 2026-09-10 | Temporal features: var_rssi_10, dber_dt, burst_ratio |
| B2 (v2) | ✅ | 92.13% | 2026-09-11 | With 7 features, reactive_jamming 7.2%→85.5% |
| B3 (9-class, v1) | ✅ | 90.90% | 2026-09-13 | +sweeping_jammer, +benign_interference, +none |
| B3 (9-class, v2) | ✅ | **98.05%** | 2026-09-18 | Post spoofing root-cause fix (see below), verified 2x independently |

**Key Finding (v1, superseded):** jamming 67.3%, spoofing 76.2% weak; noise_burst, antenna_fault, sweeping (100%). All classes now well-separated post-fix — see Session 2026-09-18 below.

---

## Phase B-exp: CNN-LSTM Detector — NOT PURSUED FURTHER

Built and evaluated (2026-09-15/16) as a proposed fix for spoofing's weak recall (proposal risk #5 mitigation: "compare multiple model architectures"). Dataset expanded to 27,246 frames specifically to give the LSTM enough sequence data.

| Config | CNN-LSTM overall | CNN+scalar (contemporary) | Delta on spoofing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Run 1 (27,246 frames) | 90.7% | — | -9.8pp vs CNN |
| Run 2 (post data-leakage fix) | lower | — | -21.8pp vs CNN |

**Decision (2026-09-16, see D13):** CNN-LSTM consistently underperformed CNN+scalar on spoofing across two dataset sizes, even after fixing sequence-window data leakage and per-class split imbalance. Once spoofing was fixed at its true root cause (see below, same day) — a data-generation bug, not a detector-architecture limitation — the entire premise for LSTM comparison dissolved: CNN alone now exceeds LSTM's best result by a wide margin with far fewer parameters. Kept in the repo (not deleted) as the actual evidence of proposal risk #5's "compare multiple architectures" mitigation.

## Phase C: Recovery & Closed-Loop ✅ COMPLETE (v6, fully verified)

### C1: Rule-Based Policy ✅
```
jamming → channel_switch (15dB)
reactive_jamming → channel_switch_fast (10dB)
sweeping_jammer → channel_switch_fast (15dB)
spoofing → freq_diversity (8dB)
path_loss → rate_reduce (6dB)
noise_burst → rate_reduce (9dB)
antenna_fault → spatial_diversity (12dB)
benign_interference → no_action
none → no_action
```
**Note (found 2026-09-19, see design clarification in README):** `rule_based_policy.m`'s own per-threat `mitigation_db` values above are computed but never applied anywhere in the closed-loop pipeline — both call sites (`run_closed_loop_diagnostic.m`, `measure_kpi3_recovery_time.m`) discard that output. Only the *action name* feeds the DQN-vs-rule agreement comparison; physical effect for both policies is computed via the shared `action_mitigation_db` (25/15/25/25dB per action name). Not a bug — the comparison is decision-policy-only by design — but must be stated precisely in the report.

### C2: DQN Agent — 6 fix iterations

| Version | Date | Fix | Root cause found | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v1 | 09-13 | — | Synthetic generic reward (same for every threat) | 12.5% rule agreement, antenna_fault 5.4% |
| v2 | 09-13 | Raised `action_mitigation_db` (15/8/8/12→25/15/25/25 dB) + physical floor on path_loss_db/fault_atten_db | Magnitudes far below what EXP validated as achievable | antenna_fault 5.4%→20.2%, mean recovery 31.8%→42.2%-45.2% |
| v3 | 09-13 | Reward shaping (-40pp false-alarm penalty, benign_interference/none) + state-mismatch fix + 3x oversampling on benign_interference/none | benign_interference/none were being "recovered" like threats; reward scale drowned out by other threats | no_action correctly ranked highest for both; DQN-Rule agreement 22.2% |
| v4-v5 | 09-14 | `threat_encode` reassignment (antenna_fault at max distance from benign_interference/none); antenna_fault oversampled 3x | Scalar ordinal encoding let antenna_fault's Q-values bleed from the adjacent benign_interference penalty code; undertraining on antenna_fault's fine-grained ranking | DQN-Rule agreement 22.2%→55.6%; antenna_fault recovery 0.7%→17-20% |
| **v6** | **09-18** | **Full one-hot state encoding (13-dim), replacing the entire scalar-ordinal `threat_encode` scheme (v4-v5's patch).** Post-training validation Gate A/B added — refuses to save an agent that fails either. | The v4-v5 fix patched the *symptom* (which codes were adjacent) but kept the underlying flaw (scalar input the network reads as continuous). One-hot removes the adjacency-bleed failure mode structurally rather than by careful code placement. | Both gates pass; no adjacency-bleed possible by construction. Single shared `build_dqn_state.m` guarantees train/inference encoding can never drift again. |

**Design note (unchanged from v5, still applies):** the four non-zero actions are mechanistically identical in the current implementation — each subtracts `action_mitigation_db.(action)` dB from the threat's own severity field. Most residual "DQN vs rule disagreement" is cosmetic.

### C3: Closed-Loop — ✅ FULLY VERIFIED (2026-09-18/19)

**Sliding-window bug found and fixed (2026-09-18):** a full SNR sweep in `run_closed_loop_diagnostic.m` revealed closed-loop detection accuracy of only 79.6% (vs 98.05% on the held-out test set), with reactive_jamming→jamming and none→path_loss failing **100%** of the time across all SNR points. Root cause: the script fed the CNN neutral placeholder values (0,0,1) for the 3 temporal features (no history exists in a single-shot run), while the CNN was trained on real sliding-window features — and reactive_jamming's entire distinguishing signature *is* its temporal pattern. Each Simulink run actually returns ~20 frames (not 1); the old script discarded 19 of them.

First fix attempt (naive) built temporal features from all 20 frames but **made things worse** (66.7% accuracy, jamming and path_loss dropped to 0%) — root cause: `run_dataset_sweep.m` marks the last frame's BER as NaN in every run (delay_bits truncation), and NaN silently propagated through the network, zeroing entire class outputs. `prepare_data.m` had always guarded against this (`feats(isnan(feats))=0`) but the closed-loop script didn't.

**Final fix:** last-valid-frame selection via `find(~isnan(ber_f),1,'last')`, NaN guards mirroring `prepare_data.m` exactly, and before/after BER both averaged across all valid frames (not single-frame-vs-single-frame, an additional noise source).

**Result: closed-loop detection accuracy 100% (54/54)** — all 9 classes, all 6 SNR points. FAR returned to normal (~0%, down from a spurious 64.5% under the broken feature pipeline).

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Detection accuracy (closed loop) | **100%** (54/54) |
| Mean BER recovery (real threats) | **74.9%** |
| Median latency (CNN+DQN) | **~3.3ms** |
| benign_interference / none | Both correctly resolve to `no_action` |

---

## Phase EXP: Deep Countermeasure Exploration ✅ COMPLETE

Ran `explore_countermeasures.m`: **2550 scenarios, 85.8 minutes**, 3 mechanisms (`field_reduction`, `awgn_margin_boost`, `atten_reduction` for antenna_fault only) across 8 threats × 5 severity levels × 6 SNR points.

**Crash bug found and fixed (2026-09-18):** `current_best_static.(b.threat)` in the report-generation section accessed a field that didn't exist for all 8 threats vs. only 6 fields in the historical comparison struct — caused the script to crash **after** 75-86 minutes of runtime, at the report-writing stage, after the actual data was already safely saved. Fixed with an `isfield` guard in the report builder (the console-output path already had one).

This EXP data feeds both the C2 `action_mitigation_db` magnitudes (established 09-13/14, unchanged since) and the survivability boundary mapping below.

---

## Survivability Boundary Mapping — Proposal Deliverable #7 ✅ COMPLETE (2026-09-19)

### Bug found and fixed: single-map conflation
The first version of `map_survivability_boundary.m` built one map from `min([sub.ber_after])` across **all** mechanisms without filtering by mechanism — silently conflating genuine threat neutralization with `awgn_margin_boost` (an SNR-margin trick that can make the link outperform the clean-channel floor without touching the attack at all). Symptom: sweeping_jammer and benign_interference showed "achieved recovery" at 221-283% *of the theoretical ceiling* — physically impossible for pure neutralization, and the tell that margin-boost was silently winning the `min()`.

### Fix: two separate maps
```matlab
MECH_A = {'atten_reduction','field_reduction'};                       % genuine neutralization
MECH_B = {'atten_reduction','field_reduction','awgn_margin_boost'};   % all available means
```

| | Map A — Threat Neutralization | Map B — Link Survivability |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanisms | atten_reduction, field_reduction | + awgn_margin_boost |
| Recoverable | 84.6% (198/234) | 87.9% (211/240) |
| Marginal | 12.4% (29/234) | 9.6% (23/240) |
| Non-recoverable | 3.0% (7/234) | 2.5% (6/240) |

sweeping_jammer and benign_interference's "of ceiling" figures dropped from 283.8%/225.5% (Map B, unfiltered) to 105.7%/104.6% (Map A) — confirming the filter isolates genuine neutralization correctly.

### Gap analysis
1 cell: **path_loss, level=8, SNR=10dB** — Map B ratio ≈ 0 (link survives, via margin) vs. Map A ratio = 6.06x (non-recoverable, threat not actually neutralized). This is the concrete instance of the proposal's goodput-tradeoff regime: the link survives by trading margin/rate, not by removing the attack.

### Known coverage gap (documented, not a bug)
`path_loss` at level=4 (its lowest severity) has **no Map A data** — confirmed root cause: `mag_field_reduction = [5 10 15 20 25]` is a single global sweep range applied to every threat, and every value in it exceeds path_loss's level=4 severity. The legitimacy filter (`level - magnitude < 0` → excluded, since it would imply unphysical signal amplification) correctly excludes all 5 candidate points at that level, leaving zero legitimate Map A records there. Map B (which includes awgn_margin_boost, unaffected by this filter) has full coverage at that level.

## Phase KPI: Proposal Measurement (section ה) ✅ COMPLETE

| KPI | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| KPI 1 — Detection accuracy | 98.05% (offline) / 100% (closed-loop) | See Phase B3 / C3 above |
| KPI 2 — BER recovery | 74.9% mean (real threats, closed-loop) | See Phase C3 above |
| KPI 3 — DQN vs Rule decision speed | Rule ~3 orders of magnitude faster | Redefined from "recovery cycles" — see below |
| KPI 4 — FAR (False Alarm Rate) | 0%, upper 95% CI bound 3% | Rule-of-Three (100 trials, zero false alarms) |
| KPI 5 — End-to-end survivability | See survivability boundary mapping above | Proposal deliverable #7 |

### KPI #3 redefinition (2026-09-18)
**Original problem:** `measure_kpi3_recovery_time.m` simulated "recovery cycles" via a halving loop that never called `sim()` or consulted either policy's actual action choice — DQN and rule-based always returned identical results regardless of which was "measured."
**Root conceptual issue:** both policies are single-shot deterministic dB reductions in this system — there is no multi-cycle convergence dynamic to measure.
**Fix:** redefined to measure decision **latency** instead. Rule-based: 1000 direct calls to `rule_based_policy.m`, averaged. DQN: pulled from the real `closed_loop_diagnostic_report.txt`. Result: rule-based faster by roughly three orders of magnitude (lookup table vs. neural network inference) — expected, but now measured correctly rather than reported as a meaningless "0 cycles for both."

**Also fixed same session:**
- `MAX_STALE_DAYS` was 3 days in `measure_all_kpis.m`/`measure_kpi3_recovery_time.m`, letting pre-DQN-fix KPI files count as "fresh" and produce numerically inconsistent aggregate reports → changed to 0.5 (12 hours).
- `diagnose_far_measurement.m`: `196*se` typo (should be `1.96*se`) in the 95% CI calculation (off by 100x); Rule-of-Three added for the FAR=0 case (a naive symmetric CI is meaningless at zero count).

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Resolved (2026-09-13/15)
Antenna Fault recovery, benign_interference reward gap, reactive_jamming misdetection false alarm, antenna_fault Q-value bleed (v1-v5), noise_burst latency test-harness artifact — see git history and prior versions of this log for full detail; all confirmed stable across independent re-runs.

### Resolved (2026-09-18)
1. **Spoofing 3-way confusion (formerly 53.0% recall)** — root-caused and fixed at the data-generation level (coherent QPSK injection, not incoherent noise). Recall now 98.7-99.7%. This was NOT a detector limitation as previously documented — it was a threat-injection bug. See D12.
2. **DQN scalar-ordinal state encoding** — replaced with one-hot (13-dim). See D14.
3. **Closed-loop sliding-window feature mismatch** — fixed; closed-loop detection accuracy 79.6%→100%. See D16.
4. **KPI #3 mock measurement** — redefined to real decision latency. See D15.
5. **explore_countermeasures.m crash-after-75min bug** — isfield guard added to report builder.
6. **Survivability map mechanism conflation** — split into Map A/Map B. See D17.

### Open (2026-09-19)
7. **`rule_based_policy.m`'s per-threat `mitigation_db` is unused dead output.** Both call sites discard it; physical mitigation for both DQN and rule-based always goes through the shared `action_mitigation_db`. Not a bug in outcome, but the report must describe the DQN-vs-rule comparison precisely as decision-policy-only, not two independently-realized countermeasure systems.
8. **`src/` directory** — exists locally (per Adi's file listing), not tracked in git, contents not yet audited.
9. **`extract_temporal_features.m`** — confirmed orphaned (not referenced by any script in the repo; its function was folded into `extract_spectrograms.m` at A6). Candidate for removal or explicit DEPRECATED marking.
10. **`.gitignore`** has 4 duplicate/overlapping `models/` entries accumulated across incremental commits — cosmetic, needs a cleanup pass.

2. Audit `src/` directory contents; decide whether to track or discard.
3. Remove or clearly deprecate `extract_temporal_features.m`.
4. Clean up duplicate `.gitignore` entries.
5. Write Phase D reports (interim + final), using this document and README.md as the factual source.
